# Smart Document Analyzer

The Smart Document Analyzer is designed to securely upload and analyze documents, providing insights through natural language processing (NLP). It supports various document types, including PDFs, images, CSV files, and DOC files, offering functionalities like keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and content summarization.

## Modules

The application is divided into two main modules:

1. **Secure File Uploader/Ingester**
2. **Text NLP Analysis**

## Secure File Uploader/Ingester

This module handles user authentication, secure file uploading, and the initial processing of files to extract text.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate users and issue a session token.
- **POST /api/files/upload**: Securely upload a document. Requires a session token.
- **GET /api/files/{fileId}/text**: Retrieve text from an uploaded document.

## Text NLP Analysis

Performs deep text analysis, including keyword tagging, sentiment analysis, topic detection, and summarization.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/analysis/keywords**: Extract keywords and topics from text.
- **POST /api/analysis/sentiments**: Analyze sentiment of text segments.
- **GET /api/analysis/search**: Search documents based on keywords, with optional sentiment or topic filters.
- **POST /api/analysis/summaries**: Generate text summaries.
- **POST /api/analysis/enrichment**: Discover related web content based on keywords.
- **POST /api/analysis/entities**: Identify names, locations, and other entities in text.

## Implementation Notes

- **Security**: Use JWT for authentication and secure API access.
- **Framework**: The project utilizes Spring Boot for streamlined RESTful service development.
- **Data Storage**: A combination of SQL and NoSQL databases is recommended for efficient data management and querying.
- **NLP Tools**: Integration with NLP libraries or services like Apache OpenNLP, Stanford NLP, or OpenAI is essential for text analysis.
- **File Conversion**: Apache PDFBox and Tesseract OCR are suggested for handling PDFs and image-based text extraction.
